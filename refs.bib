  abstract = {The classical infinitesimal model is a simple and robust model for the
inheritance of quantitative traits. In this model, a quantitative trait is
expressed as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic (environmental) component
and the genetic component of offspring traits within a family follows a normal
distribution around the average of the parents' trait values, and has a
variance that is independent of the trait values of the parents. In previous
work, Barton et al.(2017), we showed that when trait values are determined by
the sum of a large number of Mendelian factors, each of small effect, one can
justify the infinitesimal model as limit of Mendelian inheritance.
  In this paper, we show that the robustness of the infinitesimal model extends
to include dominance. We define the model in terms of classical quantities of
quantitative genetics, before justifying it as a limit of Mendelian inheritance
as the number, M, of underlying loci tends to infinity. As in the additive
case, the multivariate normal distribution of trait values across the pedigree
can be expressed in terms of variance components in an ancestral population and
identities determined by the pedigree. In this setting, it is natural to
decompose trait values, not just into the additive and dominance components,
but into a component that is shared by all individuals within the family and an
independent `residual' for each offspring, which captures the randomness of
Mendelian inheritance. We show that, even if we condition on parental trait
values, both the shared component and the residuals within each family will be
asymptotically normally distributed as the number of loci tends to infinity,
with an error of order 1/\sqrt{M}.
  We illustrate our results with some numerical examples.},

@article{barton2017infinitesimal,
  abstract = {Our focus here is on the infinitesimal model. In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed within families as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can be predicted from the variance components. This does not necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to be accurate. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure, …. We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1∕M. Simulations suggest that in some cases the convergence may be as fast as 1∕M.},

    abstract = "{Gaussian processes, a class of stochastic processes including Brownian motion and the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, are widely used to model continuous trait evolution in statistical phylogenetics. Under such processes, observations at the tips of a phylogenetic tree have a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which may lead to suboptimal model specification under certain evolutionary conditions, as supposed in models of punctuated equilibrium or adaptive radiation. To consider non-normally distributed continuous trait evolution, we introduce a method to compute posterior probabilities when modeling continuous trait evolution as a Lévy process. Through data simulation and model testing, we establish that single-rate Brownian motion (BM) and Lévy processes with jumps generate distinct patterns in comparative data. We then analyzed body mass and endocranial volume measurements for 126 primates. We rejected single-rate BM in favor of a Lévy process with jumps for each trait, with the lineage leading to most recent common ancestor of great apes showing particularly strong evidence against single-rate BM.
