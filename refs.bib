  abstract = {The classical infinitesimal model is a simple and robust model for the
inheritance of quantitative traits. In this model, a quantitative trait is
expressed as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic (environmental) component
and the genetic component of offspring traits within a family follows a normal
distribution around the average of the parents' trait values, and has a
variance that is independent of the trait values of the parents. In previous
work, Barton et al.(2017), we showed that when trait values are determined by
the sum of a large number of Mendelian factors, each of small effect, one can
justify the infinitesimal model as limit of Mendelian inheritance.
  In this paper, we show that the robustness of the infinitesimal model extends
to include dominance. We define the model in terms of classical quantities of
quantitative genetics, before justifying it as a limit of Mendelian inheritance
as the number, M, of underlying loci tends to infinity. As in the additive
case, the multivariate normal distribution of trait values across the pedigree
can be expressed in terms of variance components in an ancestral population and
identities determined by the pedigree. In this setting, it is natural to
decompose trait values, not just into the additive and dominance components,
but into a component that is shared by all individuals within the family and an
independent `residual' for each offspring, which captures the randomness of
Mendelian inheritance. We show that, even if we condition on parental trait
values, both the shared component and the residuals within each family will be
asymptotically normally distributed as the number of loci tends to infinity,
with an error of order 1/\sqrt{M}.
  We illustrate our results with some numerical examples.},

@article{barton2017infinitesimal,
  abstract = {Our focus here is on the infinitesimal model. In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed within families as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can be predicted from the variance components. This does not necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to be accurate. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure, …. We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1∕M. Simulations suggest that in some cases the convergence may be as fast as 1∕M.},

Under such processes, observations at the tips of a phylogenetic tree have a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which may lead to suboptimal model specification under certain evolutionary conditions, as supposed in models of punctuated equilibrium or adaptive radiation. To consider non-normally distributed continuous trait evolution, we introduce a method to compute posterior probabilities when modeling continuous trait evolution as a Lévy process. Through data simulation and model testing, we establish that single-rate Brownian motion (BM) and Lévy processes with jumps generate distinct patterns in comparative data. We then analyzed body mass and endocranial volume measurements for 126 primates. We rejected single-rate BM in favor of a Lévy process with jumps for each trait, with the lineage leading to most recent common ancestor of great apes showing particularly strong evidence against single-rate BM.

    abstract = {The relative importance of different modes of evolution in shaping phenotypic diversity remains a hotly debated question. Fossil data suggest that stasis may be a common mode of evolution, while modern data suggest some lineages experience very fast rates of evolution. One way to reconcile these observations is to imagine that evolution proceeds in pulses, rather than in increments, on geological timescales. To test this hypothesis, we developed a maximum-likelihood framework for fitting Lévy processes to comparative morphological data. This class of stochastic processes includes both an incremental and a pulsed component. We found that a plurality of modern vertebrate clades examined are best fitted by pulsed processes over models of incremental change, stationarity, and adaptive radiation. When we compare our results to theoretical expectations of the rate and speed of regime shifts for models that detail fitness landscape dynamics, we find that our quantitative results are broadly compatible with both microevolutionary models and observations from the fossil record.}

We modeled artificial selection in samples drawn from natural populations in which variation had been maintained by recurrent mutation, with genes having an effect on the trait, which was subject to real stabilizing selection, and a pleitropic effect on fitness (the joint-effect model). Natural selection leads to an inverse correlation between effects and frequencies of genes, such that the frequency distribution of genes increasing the trait has an extreme U-shape. In contrast to the classical infinitesimal model, an early accelerated response and a larger variance of response among replicates were predicted. However, these are reduced if the base population has been maintained in the laboratory for some generations by random sampling prior to artificial selection. When multiple loci and linkage are also taken into account, the gametic disequilibria generated by the Bulmer and Hill-Robertson effects are such that little or no increase in variance and acceleration of response in early generations of artificial selection are predicted; further, the patterns of predicted responses for the joint-effect model now become close to those of the infinitesimal model. Comparison with data from laboratory selection experiments shows that, overall, the analysis did not provide clear support for the joint-effect model or a clear case for rejection.}",

When a population is subdivided into demes with selection toward different local optima, migration between demes may result in asymmetric, or skewed, local distributions. Using a simplified two-habitat model, we derive formulas without a priori assuming a Gaussian distribution of genotypic values, and we find expressions that naturally incorporate higher moments, such as skew. These formulas yield predictions of the expected divergence under migration-selection balance that are more accurate than models assuming Gaussian distributions, which illustrates the importance of incorporating these higher moments to assess the response to selection in heterogeneous environments. We further show with simulations that traits with loci of large effect display the largest skew in their distribution at migration-selection balance.},

  abstract = {

Current methods for genomewide selection do not distinguish between known major genes and random genomewide markers. My objectives were to determine if explicitly modeling the effects of known major genes affects the response to genomewide selection, and to identify situations in which considering major genes as having fixed effects is helpful. Simulation experiments showed that having a fixed effect for a major gene became more advantageous as the percentage of genetic variance (VG) explained by a major gene (R2) increased and as the heritability on an entry-mean basis (h2) increased. With R2 = 50% and h2 = 0.80, the relative efficiency (based on selection gains in Cycle 4) with a major gene having a fixed versus random effect was 112–121%. Specifying a fixed effect for a single major gene was never disadvantageous except with R2 < 10%. With h2 ≥ 0.50, specifying a fixed versus random effect for a single major gene had little effect on prediction accuracy in Cycle 0. However, prediction accuracy in later cycles declined more rapidly when a major gene had a random effect instead of a fixed effect. The results with L = 2 or 3 major genes were similar to those with one major gene. In contrast, the usefulness of gene information was low with L = 10 major genes. Overall, major genes should be fitted as having fixed effects in genomewide selection when only a few major genes are present and each major gene accounts for ≥10% of VG.

@article{rice2019evaluation,
  abstract = {Certain agronomic crop traits are complex and thus governed by many small-effect loci. Statistical models typically used in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) quantify these signals by assessing genomic marker contributions in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with these loci to trait variation. These models have been used in separate quantitative genetics contexts until recently, when, in published studies, the predictive ability of GS models that include peak associated markers from a GWAS as fixed-effect covariates was assessed. Previous work suggests that such models could be useful for predicting traits controlled by several large-effect and many small-effect genes. We expand this work by evaluating simulated traits from diversity panels in maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] using ridge-regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) models that include fixed-effect covariates tagging peak GWAS signals. The ability of such covariates to increase GS prediction accuracy in the RR-BLUP model under a wide variety of genetic architectures and genomic backgrounds was quantified. Of the 216 genetic architectures that we simulated, we identified 60 where the addition of fixed-effect covariates boosted prediction accuracy. However, for the majority of the simulated data, no increase or a decrease in prediction accuracy was observed. We also noted several instances where the inclusion of fixed-effect covariates increased both the variability of prediction accuracies and the bias of the genomic estimated breeding values. We therefore recommend that the performance of such a GS model be explored on a trait-by-trait basis prior to its implementation into a breeding program.},
