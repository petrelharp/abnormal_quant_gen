@misc{barton2022infinitesimal,
	abstract = {The classical infinitesimal model is a simple and robust model for the
inheritance of quantitative traits. In this model, a quantitative trait is
expressed as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic (environmental) component
and the genetic component of offspring traits within a family follows a normal
distribution around the average of the parents' trait values, and has a
variance that is independent of the trait values of the parents. In previous
work, Barton et al.(2017), we showed that when trait values are determined by
the sum of a large number of Mendelian factors, each of small effect, one can
justify the infinitesimal model as limit of Mendelian inheritance.
  In this paper, we show that the robustness of the infinitesimal model extends
to include dominance. We define the model in terms of classical quantities of
quantitative genetics, before justifying it as a limit of Mendelian inheritance
as the number, M, of underlying loci tends to infinity. As in the additive
case, the multivariate normal distribution of trait values across the pedigree
can be expressed in terms of variance components in an ancestral population and
identities determined by the pedigree. In this setting, it is natural to
decompose trait values, not just into the additive and dominance components,
but into a component that is shared by all individuals within the family and an
independent `residual' for each offspring, which captures the randomness of
Mendelian inheritance. We show that, even if we condition on parental trait
values, both the shared component and the residuals within each family will be
asymptotically normally distributed as the number of loci tends to infinity,
with an error of order 1/\sqrt{M}.
  We illustrate our results with some numerical examples.},

@article{barton2017infinitesimal,
	abstract = {Our focus here is on the infinitesimal model. In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed within families as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can be predicted from the variance components. This does not necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to be accurate. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure, {\ldots}. We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1∕M. Simulations suggest that in some cases the convergence may be as fast as 1∕M.},

@article{landis2012phylogenetic,
	abstract = {{Gaussian processes, a class of stochastic processes including Brownian motion and the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, are widely used to model continuous trait evolution in statistical phylogenetics. Under such processes, observations at the tips of a phylogenetic tree have a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which may lead to suboptimal model specification under certain evolutionary conditions, as supposed in models of punctuated equilibrium or adaptive radiation. To consider non-normally distributed continuous trait evolution, we introduce a method to compute posterior probabilities when modeling continuous trait evolution as a L{\'e}vy process. Through data simulation and model testing, we establish that single-rate Brownian motion (BM) and L{\'e}vy processes with jumps generate distinct patterns in comparative data. We then analyzed body mass and endocranial volume measurements for 126 primates. We rejected single-rate BM in favor of a L{\'e}vy process with jumps for each trait, with the lineage leading to most recent common ancestor of great apes showing particularly strong evidence against single-rate BM.

@article{landis2017pulsed,
	abstract = {The relative importance of different modes of evolution in shaping phenotypic diversity remains a hotly debated question. Fossil data suggest that stasis may be a common mode of evolution, while modern data suggest some lineages experience very fast rates of evolution. One way to reconcile these observations is to imagine that evolution proceeds in pulses, rather than in increments, on geological timescales. To test this hypothesis, we developed a maximum-likelihood framework for fitting L{\'e}vy processes to comparative morphological data. This class of stochastic processes includes both an incremental and a pulsed component. We found that a plurality of modern vertebrate clades examined are best fitted by pulsed processes over models of incremental change, stationarity, and adaptive radiation. When we compare our results to theoretical expectations of the rate and speed of regime shifts for models that detail fitness landscape dynamics, we find that our quantitative results are broadly compatible with both microevolutionary models and observations from the fossil record.},

@article{zhang2005predictions,
	abstract = {{The pattern of response to artificial selection on quantitative traits in laboratory populations can tell us something of the genetic architecture in the natural population from which they were derived. We modeled artificial selection in samples drawn from natural populations in which variation had been maintained by recurrent mutation, with genes having an effect on the trait, which was subject to real stabilizing selection, and a pleitropic effect on fitness (the joint-effect model). Natural selection leads to an inverse correlation between effects and frequencies of genes, such that the frequency distribution of genes increasing the trait has an extreme U-shape. In contrast to the classical infinitesimal model, an early accelerated response and a larger variance of response among replicates were predicted. However, these are reduced if the base population has been maintained in the laboratory for some generations by random sampling prior to artificial selection. When multiple loci and linkage are also taken into account, the gametic disequilibria generated by the Bulmer and Hill-Robertson effects are such that little or no increase in variance and acceleration of response in early generations of artificial selection are predicted; further, the patterns of predicted responses for the joint-effect model now become close to those of the infinitesimal model. Comparison with data from laboratory selection experiments shows that, overall, the analysis did not provide clear support for the joint-effect model or a clear case for rejection.}},

@article{debarre2015evolution,
	abstract = {AbstractQuantitative-genetic models of differentiation under migration-selection balance often rely on the assumption of normally distributed genotypic and phenotypic values. When a population is subdivided into demes with selection toward different local optima, migration between demes may result in asymmetric, or skewed, local distributions. Using a simplified two-habitat model, we derive formulas without a priori assuming a Gaussian distribution of genotypic values, and we find expressions that naturally incorporate higher moments, such as skew. These formulas yield predictions of the expected divergence under migration-selection balance that are more accurate than models assuming Gaussian distributions, which illustrates the importance of incorporating these higher moments to assess the response to selection in heterogeneous environments. We further show with simulations that traits with loci of large effect display the largest skew in their distribution at migration-selection balance.},

with additive effects for alleles at a market quantitative trait locus (MQTL) and additive
effects for alleles at the remaining quantitative trait loci (QTL). A recursive algorithm
is developed to obtain the covariance matrix of the effects of MQTL alleles. A simple
method is presented to obtain its inverse. This approach allows simultaneous evaluation
of fixed effects, effects of MQTL alleles, and effects of alleles at the remaining QTLs, using
known relationships and phenotypic and marker information. The approach is sufficiently
general to accommodate individuals with partial or no marker information. Extension of
the approach to BLUP with multiple markers is discussed.

@article{bernardo2014genomewide,
	abstract = {

Current methods for genomewide selection do not distinguish between known major genes and random genomewide markers. My objectives were to determine if explicitly modeling the effects of known major genes affects the response to genomewide selection, and to identify situations in which considering major genes as having fixed effects is helpful. Simulation experiments showed that having a fixed effect for a major gene became more advantageous as the percentage of genetic variance (VG) explained by a major gene (R2) increased and as the heritability on an entry-mean basis (h2) increased. With R2 = 50% and h2 = 0.80, the relative efficiency (based on selection gains in Cycle 4) with a major gene having a fixed versus random effect was 112--121%. Specifying a fixed effect for a single major gene was never disadvantageous except with R2 < 10%. With h2 ≥ 0.50, specifying a fixed versus random effect for a single major gene had little effect on prediction accuracy in Cycle 0. However, prediction accuracy in later cycles declined more rapidly when a major gene had a random effect instead of a fixed effect. The results with L = 2 or 3 major genes were similar to those with one major gene. In contrast, the usefulness of gene information was low with L = 10 major genes. Overall, major genes should be fitted as having fixed effects in genomewide selection when only a few major genes are present and each major gene accounts for ≥10% of VG.

	abstract = {Certain agronomic crop traits are complex and thus governed by many small-effect loci. Statistical models typically used in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) quantify these signals by assessing genomic marker contributions in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with these loci to trait variation. These models have been used in separate quantitative genetics contexts until recently, when, in published studies, the predictive ability of GS models that include peak associated markers from a GWAS as fixed-effect covariates was assessed. Previous work suggests that such models could be useful for predicting traits controlled by several large-effect and many small-effect genes. We expand this work by evaluating simulated traits from diversity panels in maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] using ridge-regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) models that include fixed-effect covariates tagging peak GWAS signals. The ability of such covariates to increase GS prediction accuracy in the RR-BLUP model under a wide variety of genetic architectures and genomic backgrounds was quantified. Of the 216 genetic architectures that we simulated, we identified 60 where the addition of fixed-effect covariates boosted prediction accuracy. However, for the majority of the simulated data, no increase or a decrease in prediction accuracy was observed. We also noted several instances where the inclusion of fixed-effect covariates increased both the variability of prediction accuracies and the bias of the genomic estimated breeding values. We therefore recommend that the performance of such a GS model be explored on a trait-by-trait basis prior to its implementation into a breeding program.},

	abstract = {{Many ecologically important traits have a complex genetic basis, with the potential for mutations at many different genes to shape the phenotype. Even so, studies of local adaptation in heterogeneous environments sometimes find that just a few quantitative trait loci (QTL) of large effect can explain a large percentage of observed differences between phenotypically divergent populations. As high levels of gene flow can swamp divergence at weakly selected alleles, migration--selection--drift balance may play an important role in shaping the genetic architecture of local adaptation. Here, we use analytical approximations and individual‐based simulations to explore how genetic architecture evolves when two populations connected by migration experience stabilizing selection toward different optima. In contrast to the exponential distribution of allele effect sizes expected under adaptation without migration (Orr 1998), we find that adaptation with migration tends to result in concentrated genetic architectures with fewer, larger, and more tightly linked divergent alleles. Even if many small alleles contribute to adaptation at the outset, they tend to be replaced by a few large alleles under prolonged bouts of stabilizing selection with migration. All else being equal, we also find that stronger selection can maintain linked clusters of locally adapted alleles over much greater map distances than weaker selection. The common empirical finding of QTL of large effect is shown to be expected with migration in a heterogeneous landscape, and these QTL may often be composed of several tightly linked alleles of smaller effect.}},

	abstract = {{We study the evolution of inversions that capture locally adapted alleles when two populations are exchanging migrants or hybridizing. By suppressing recombination between the loci, a new inversion can spread. Neither drift nor coadaptation between the alleles (epistasis) is needed, so this local adaptation mechanism may apply to a broader range of genetic and demographic situations than alternative hypotheses that have been widely discussed. The mechanism can explain many features observed in inversion systems. It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations, which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally favored alleles. The mechanism can establish underdominant inversions that decrease heterokaryotype fitness by several percent if the cause of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance that can result. The mechanism is expected to cause loci responsible for adaptive species-specific differences to map to inversions, as seen in recent QTL studies. We discuss data that support the hypothesis, review other mechanisms for inversion evolution, and suggest possible tests.}},

	abstract = {AbstractQuantitative-genetic models of differentiation under migration-selection balance often rely on the assumption of normally distributed genotypic and phenotypic values. When a population is subdivided into demes with selection toward different local optima, migration between demes may result in asymmetric, or skewed, local distributions. Using a simplified two-habitat model, we derive formulas without a priori assuming a Gaussian distribution of genotypic values, and we find expressions that naturally incorporate higher moments, such as skew. These formulas yield predictions of the expected divergence under migration-selection balance that are more accurate than models assuming Gaussian distributions, which illustrates the importance of incorporating these higher moments to assess the response to selection in heterogeneous environments. We further show with simulations that traits with loci of large effect display the largest skew in their distribution at migration-selection balance.},

@article{turelli1994genetic,
	abstract = {We develop a general population genetic framework for analyzing selection on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and disruptive selection on an additive polygenic trait. We first present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal model, in which offspring breeding values are normally distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance. These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and recombination. The population is represented by multilocus cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis. Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait, it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical deviations frequently found between predicted and observed responses to artificial selection are not caused by linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality. Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency dynamics that depend on genetic details.},

@article{cyclodiene-resistance,
	abstract = {This review follows progress in the analysis of cyclodiene insecticide resistance from the initial isolation of the mutant, through cloning of the resistance gene, to an examination of the distribution of resistance alleles in natural populations. Emphasis is given to the use of a resistant Drosophila mutant as an entry point to cloning the associated γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunit gene, Resistance to dieldrin. Resistance is associated with replacements of a single amino acid (alanine302) in the chloride ion channel pore of the protein. Replacements of alanine302 not only directly affect the drug binding site but also allosterically destabilize the drug preferred conformation of the receptor. Resistance is thus conferred by a unique dual mechanism associated with alanine302, which is the only residue replaced in a wide range of different resistant insects. The underlying mutations appear either to have arisen once, or multiply, depending on the population biology of the pest insect. Although resistance frequencies decline in the absence of selection, resistance alleles can persist at relatively high frequency and may cause problems for compounds to which cross-resistance is observed, such as the novel fipronils.},

	abstract = {The study of pigmentation has played an important role in the intersection of evolution, genetics, and developmental biology. Pigmentation's utility as a visible phenotypic marker has resulted in over 100 years of intense study of coat color mutations in laboratory mice, thereby creating an impressive list of candidate genes and an understanding of the developmental mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic effects. Variation in color and pigment patterning has also served as the focus of many classic studies of naturally occurring phenotypic variation in a wide variety of vertebrates, providing some of the most compelling cases for parallel and convergent evolution. Thus, the pigmentation model system holds much promise for understanding the nature of adaptation by linking genetic changes to variation in fitness-related traits. Here, I first discuss the historical role of pigmentation in genetics, development and evolutionary biology. I then discuss recent empirically based studies in vertebrates, which rely on these historical foundations to make connections between genotype and phenotype for ecologically important pigmentation traits. These studies provide insight into the evolutionary process by uncovering the genetic basis of adaptive traits and addressing such long-standing questions in evolutionary biology as (1) are adaptive changes predominantly caused by mutations in regulatory regions or coding regions? (2) is adaptation driven by the fixation of dominant mutations? and (3) to what extent are parallel phenotypic changes caused by similar genetic changes? It is clear that coloration has much to teach us about the molecular basis of organismal diversity, adaptation and the evolutionary process.},

In an attempt to test this trend genome wide, we integrated several previously published data sets to examine whether the position of genes in the whole-genome transcriptional network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is associated with the amount of cis-regulatory expression divergence between S. cerevisiae and its sibling species Saccharomyces paradoxus. We find little evidence for an association between connectivity and divergence in the global network that combines data from multiple conditions. However, relationships between connectivity and divergence are apparent in some of the smaller subnetworks. Despite a slight tendency for genes with more transcriptional interactions to show greater divergence, these differences explain no more than a small fraction of variation in evolutionary rates. These results suggest that the systems biology focus on large interactomes may miss some critical details of local interactions. More detailed experimental analysis will be needed to define the genetic pathways that control specific phenotypic traits and quantify the rate of regulatory changes at different points in these pathways.},

@article{smith2023isolation,
	abstract = {{Limited dispersal of individuals between generations results in isolation by distance, in which individuals further apart in space tend to be less related. Classic models of isolation by distance assume that dispersal distances are drawn from a thin-tailed distribution and predict that the proportion of the genome that is identical by descent between a pair of individuals should decrease exponentially with the spatial separation between them. However, in many natural populations, individuals occasionally disperse over very long distances. In this work, we use mathematical analysis and coalescent simulations to study the effect of long-range (power-law) dispersal on patterns of isolation by distance. We find that it leads to power-law decay of identity-by-descent at large distances with the same exponent as dispersal. We also find that broad power-law dispersal produces another, shallow power-law decay of identity-by-descent at short distances. These results suggest that the distribution of long-range dispersal events could be estimated from sequencing large population samples taken from a wide range of spatial scales.}},

@article{benhamou2007animals,
	abstract = {L\{\'e\}vy walks (LW) are superdiffusive and scale-free random walks that have recently emerged as a new conceptual tool for modeling animal search paths. They have been claimed to be more efficient than the "classical" random walks, and they also seem able to account for the actual search patterns of various species. This suggests that many animals may move using a LW process. LW patterns look like the actual search patterns displayed by animals foraging in a patchy environment, where extensive and intensive searching modes alternate, and which can be generated by a mixture of classical random walks. In this context, even elementary composite Brownian walks are more efficient than LW but may be confounded with them because they present apparent move-length-heavy tail distributions and superdiffusivity. The move-length "survival" distribution (i.e., the cumulative number of moves greater than any given threshold) appears to be a better means to highlight a LW pattern. Even once such a pattern has been clearly identified, it remains to determine how it was actually generated, because a LW pattern is not necessarily produced by a LW process but may emerge from the way the animal interacted with the environment structure through more classical movement processes. In any case, emergent movement patterns should not be confused with the processes that gave rise to them.},

@article{paulose2019spatial,
	abstract = {Author summary When a species is spread out over a large geographic range, different regions may adapt to the same selection pressure by acquiring distinct beneficial mutations. The resulting pattern of genetic variation in the population is called a soft sweep. Dispersal strongly influences soft sweep patterns, as it determines how a mutation that arose in one region might spread to others. Although most plant and animal populations experience some amount of dispersal over very long distances, the impact of such long-range dispersal events on soft sweep patterns remains poorly understood. We use computer simulations and mathematical analysis to study patterns of genetic variation in a model of soft sweeps including long-range dispersal. We show that long-range dispersal leaves distinct signatures in the genetic makeup of the population, which can be detected in genetic samples from individuals across the range. Our results are important for correctly interpreting patterns of genetic diversity in populations that have undergone recent adaptation.},

 abstract = {The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events than the classical models of population genetics. This is accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems that in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations this can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of adaptive zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive topography for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive topography for gene frequencies. This shows that for most phenotypic characters under natural selection, the evolution of the average phenotype in a population is always toward an adaptive zone of high mean fitness (W̄) in the phenotype space. Frequency-dependent selection may cause the average phenotype to evolve away from its adaptive zone, decreasing the mean fitness of individuals in the population; different types of frequency-dependent selection are classified as to whether or not they lead to such maladaptive evolution. A simple formula for estimating the minimum selective mortality per generation necessary to explain observed rates of phenotypic evolution is derived (assuming that genetic drift was not involved). The minimum mortality rates needed to explain observed rates of evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary mammals are very small, typically about one selective death per million individuals per generation. This leads to consideration of the hypothesis that these changes were caused by random genetic drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the observed evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations, with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain. Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that if stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is not very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones may be an important mechanism of evolution in populations of effective size in the hundreds or thousands. These results support the contention that random genetic drift may play a significant role in phenotypic evolution.},
